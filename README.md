# Turing_Machine
Are you interested in project based learning?
No, I'm interested in learning based projecting.

I asked my programming teacher how to create a Turing Machine that reaches the nth prime.
He thought I was joking.
He was WRONG.
I never make jokes :)

Anyways, to grok how Turing machines, as described in Automata and Computability, by Dexter C. Kozen, work, here are:
- A Turing Machine that accepts if a number n doesn't divide another number m and rejects otherwise.
            Its input should be: a 0, followed by (n-1) 1s followed by an 8, followed by (m-1) 2s followed by a 9.
- A Turing Machine that detects whether a number >=2 is prime.
            Its input should be: a 0, followed by a 1, followed by an 8, followed [...]
The input for
